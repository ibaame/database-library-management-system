<h1 align="center">Database Library management System</h1>

In this project, you will use a Database Management System to create and manipulate a very small database system for a library

<hr>

### **Data model**

We need to store information about different types of employees (Managers, Workers), Library Branches in different colleges , Students, Books, Publisher (Books details such as ISBN, author, published date, publisher name and address). Borrow information (Books ISBM, students who borrows it, borrow date and due date , an employee who give the books to the borrowers, ... etc). Other requirements are as follows: 

1. An employee can be either a worker or a manager.
2. A library has different branches distributed in colleges (Computer School Library, Eng. School libraries, ... etc). 
3. These branches must have only one manager and can have either one or multiple employees.
4. Each branch contains books related to the school. 
5. Only students can borrow books and the borrow process must be approved by a worker.
6. A student can borrow any books but a book canâ€™t be borrowed if all copies of that book are reserved.
7. A student can perform two actions:
    * Reserve a book and this must include the borrow information such as (ISBN, Borrow date, Due Date, Branch number, the employee who approve it)
    * Return a book and that might include all the information related to the returning  process.
    * Students who did not return books should be listed in the black list and they can not borrow any books within 30 days.
